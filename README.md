# Fortunes of War - Cataclysm Spawn Overlay (AHK)
I made a handy AHK script, that helps display enemy spawn locations and the composition of all 8 waves for “Fortunes of War” (Cataclysm).

It is designed for quick and convenient viewing of enemy spawns during gameplay. This will be especially useful in moments when you don't have time to switch to another window with a tooltip (ALT+TAB).

**List of features:**
- Essential information about all waves
- Convenient navigation
- Color coding
- Change hotkeys
- Adjust overlay transparency
- Save window position on screen

## Installation
1. First, go to the releases page [GitHub](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://github.com/ChadMasodin/FoW-Spawn-Overlay/releases).
2. In the list of assets, select the archive.
3. Unzip the archive to any location on your disk and install <ins>AutoHotKey v1.1</ins>.
4. Done, you can now run the AHK script.

## How it works
I've written a separate guide in Steam on how to use it. Be sure to familiarize yourself with it so that you don't have any questions.
